# Module 8: Birds of a feather

#Module 8: Birds of a feather
.pull-left[

**Overview of TGM**

The Gulf of Mexico spans ~1,000 km across — a major ecological barrier.

Many Neotropical–Nearctic migrants (e.g. warblers, thrushes, orioles) cross it twice yearly.

Crossing requires continuous flight over open water (18–24 h).
]

.pull-right[
**Energetic Demands**

Birds accumulate large fat stores (up to 40% body mass) before departure.

Departure timing depends on *wind assistance* and weather fronts.

High mortality risk if headwinds, storms, or energy stores insufficient.

**Ecological Drivers**

Spring migration: reach breeding grounds early; strong selection for speed.

Fall migration: less time pressure; routes often longer but safer.

Stopover sites (Yucatán, Louisiana) are critical for refueling and survival.
]

.pull-right[
**Species & Strategies**

Small passerines (warblers, buntings): nonstop nocturnal flight.

Larger species (hawks, herons): circum-Gulf routes over land.

Some shorebirds use coastal stepping stones (Cuba–Florida Keys chain).

**Conservation Context**

Habitat loss at stopover sites (e.g., coastal marshes) threatens populations.

Predicting responses to climate change and storm frequency is a key focus.

# eBird and GBIF

.pull-left[

**What is eBird?**

- A global citizen science platform for bird observation data, freely available for research, etc.

- Developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (launched 2002).

- Over 1.5 billion bird records from more than 800,000 contributors.

**What Data Are Collected?**

- Species observed

- Count (abundance)

- Location (GPS or hotspot), date, time, duration, and effort

- Optional photos, audio, or breeding codes

# eBird and GBIF

.pull-left[

**Who Provides the Data?**

- Birdwatchers (“citizen scientists”) log checklists via
the eBird mobile app or website.

- Submissions undergo automated filters and expert review.

- Contributors gain feedback, stats, and maps of their observations.

**Why It Matters**

- Enables real-time (kinda) tracking of migration, abundance, and phenology.

- Supports ecological and land-use modeling.

- Bridges the gap between public engagement and scientific discovery.

# eBird and GBIF
.pull-left[

**What is GBIF?**

- An international open-data infrastructure for biodiversity records.

- Established in 2001 under the OECD Global Science Forum.

- Provides free, standardized access to >2 billion species occurrence records worldwide.

- Integrates data from museums, herbaria, research projects, and citizen science (including eBird).
]

.pull-right[
**Core Mission**

To make all biodiversity data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR principles).

Supports global monitoring, species distribution modeling, and policy frameworks like IPBES and the Convention on Biological Diversity.

**What Data Are Included**

- Species occurrences (presence records)

- Taxonomic names & classifications

- *Georeferenced* coordinates

- *Temporal data* (collection dates)

- Environmental & sampling metadata


**Who Contributes**

Museums, universities, government agencies, NGOs, and citizen-science platforms (e.g., iNaturalist, eBird, iDigBio).
]

.pull-right[
**Why It Matters**

- Enables global biodiversity synthesis and macroecological research (us!).

- Informs conservation priorities, invasive species management, and climate change responses.
