<p>Welcome to BIOL 3140, Experimental Methods in Organismal
Biology!!!</p>
<p>Organismal biology is the study of living systems of all scales that
shape the structure, function, ecology, and evolution of individual
organisms. Experiments that elucidate how organisms respond t0 biotic
and abiotic environmental stimulus over broad time scales—from changes
in behavior to adaptation-are crucial to understanding biological
diversity. In this course we’ll explore the concepts and experimental
and analytical tools that frame research in organismal biology. Through
group projects and active learning exercises, students will make
hypotheses concerning how organisms respond in time, space, and behavior
to changes in environment and then design experiments and instrument
prototypes that produce data to evaluate these hypotheses. Topics
covered will include reconstructing phylogenetic history and the
evolution of organismal form and function, evaluating form-function
relationships, and the correlates of spatial and temporal distribution
of organisms. In addition, the development of an analytical
toolbox—specifically, learning the principles of data science and
statistical analysis-is a central theme of this course.</p>

<p>This is a highly technical course and will surely challenge us all.
BIOL 3140 is designed for folks with no coding or prototyping
experience, so at many times in the course, a student will feel lost and
confused. <strong><em>This is exactly where we want to be!</em></strong>
This is where the learning happens.</p>

<h1>Course materials</h1>
<ul>
<li>Personal computer [Required]
<!-- + A USB/USBc adapter for reading microSD cards [e.g.,for newer macs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RL5L8ZL/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_EE-oFbWCT79QA) [optional] -->
<!-- + A USBc adapter for USB2 connection [e.g.,for newer macs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RL5L8ZL/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_EE-oFbWCT79QA) [optional] --></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a> [Required]
<!-- + Course DAQpack (see blow) [Provided] --></li>
</ul>
<!-- ## Course hardware -->
<!-- Our Arduino units require connections to a standard USB (i.e., USB2 or 3) port on your computer. For more recent Mac and PC laptops that have only USBc, this will require an adapter. Similarly, to read data from a microSD card (required for a Phase II project), you may need an adapter. Fortunately, many adapter models---like the one linked above---include both USB2/3 and microSD interfaces. -->
<div id="github-account" class="section level2">
<h2>GitHub account</h2>
<p>Why a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a>? GitHub is
a handy place for those developing code and offers free hosting of
websites produced and maintained from a desktop (that’s how this site
was constructed). Our site is under the ``class” repository (i.e., a
space where code resides) within the organization <a
href="https://github.com/bcorgbio">bcorgbio</a> and the team “orgbiof25”
on GitHub. To access our organization and this semester’s team, you’ll
need an account. Once you have an account, I’ll be able to add you to
our <a href="https://github.com/bcorgbio">bcorgbio</a> organization and
the class-wide team for discussion purposes.</p>
<p>You should also use github to create you’re own private repository
with a name that matches your BC username (e.g., “kenaley”). We’ll use
this repo to return feedback and corrected work. As a class, we’ll make
our private repositories in class.</p>
<!-- ## Course DAQPack -->
<!-- This is pre-packaged assembly of hardware required for all the course instrumentation projects. Every student in the class will be issued a DAQPack on early in the course. **Take care of these components!!!** Put these items in a safe, dry place until you need to use them. All materials must be returned at the end of the class. -->

<div id="course-scope-goals-and-objectives" class="section level1">
<h1>Course scope, goals, and objectives</h1>
<p>To be an effective organismal biologist, one must prepare, analyze,
visualize, and communicate data as we formulate answers to the questions
we’re asking. Despite the importance of these technological skills to
our discipline, students often see the acquisition and analysis of data
as technological black boxes. Countless times in previous courses,
instructors have no doubt demonstrated foundational principles and
concepts through the presentation of data, usually through figures in
papers or lecture slides. However, where these data come from and how
they have answered a question often remain a mystery. In turn, students
must rely on the authority of their instructors rather than their own
grasp of quantitative skills and data collection to make meaningful
connections.</p>
<p>The thrust of BIOL 3140 is to develop and hone meaningful
quantitative skills relevant to organismal biology.</p>

<div class="col-sm-9">
<p>As was mentioned at the top, students will often feel adrift, unsure
of how to proceed. This is by design and a model of how experimental
work and data analysis in biology unfolds. Nonetheless, students may
worry about their grade in the course and how to do well when challenges
emerge at every turn. Fear not! For each assignment in the course (e.g.,
module project reports) student or team engagement and effort will be
assessed just as much as how well objective questions have been
answered.</p>

<div id="course-goals-and-objectives" class="section level2">
<h2>Course goals and objectives</h2>
<!-- With respect to instrumentation, the learning goals of this program include: -->
<!-- 1. Understanding how common sensors convert physical phenomena into electrical signals. -->
<!-- 2. Familiarity with the basics of signal conditioning, amplification, and the conversion of sensor signals into a form that can be converted into digital values. -->
<!-- 3. Understanding the basics of analog-to-digital conversion and digital signal acquisition. -->
<!-- 4. Development of basic programming skills that permit flexible repurposing of a common data-acquisition system. -->
<!-- The specific learning objectives of our instrumentation work include: -->
<!-- 1. Development of 3 instruments which detect temperature, force, and acceleration in human subjects. -->
<!-- 2. Assembly and programming of an Arduino-based data-acquisition system to process and condition signals from a variety of sensor types. -->
<!-- For students in the natural sciences, perhaps more important than understanding how data is acquired is understanding how to analyze data in the context of answering a specific question. To this end, we will pursue the following data science learning goals that include: -->
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Learning how to import data into a computing environment.</li>
<li>Understanding basic tidying and transforming (i.e., wrangling)
operations of data to answer scientific questions.</li>
<li>Developing competency in basic data visualization.</li>
<li>Learning how to model data in the context of answering a scientific
question.</li>
<li>Executing the critical basics of communication in a data science
framework.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these data-science learning goals will be realized in the
framework of the R computing environment. Using R, students will open
the black box of data analysis and pursue these specific objectives:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Import, tidy, and transform sensor data so that specific scientific
questions can be asked.</li>
<li>Visualize sensor data in the R environment using ggplot, an elegant
and versatile tool for data visualization.</li>
<li>Evaluate a-priori scientific questions within a modeling framework,
rejecting or accepting hypotheses according to model expectations.</li>
<li>Communicate answers in concise reports, leveraging R’s fast and
reproducible markdown capabilities.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="course-format-and-expectations" class="section level1">
<h1>Course format and expectations</h1>
<div id="lectures" class="section level2">
<h2>Lectures</h2>
<p>Our course will be a semi-flipped, partially self-guided experience.
This will require students to read and explore outside of class and meet
in pre-assigned smaller groups (i.e., teams) on their own to work
through the material. We will use class time to introduce concepts,
tackle sticky problems, and answer specific questions. In addition, I
will be available during office hours.</p>
</div>
<div id="teams-and-team-responsibilities" class="section level2">
<h2>Teams and team responsibilities</h2>
<p>To facilitate our team approach, I’ll be assigning each student to a
team of 3 students for group projects. The teams will be number, i.e.,
“Team 1”, “Team2”, etc.</p>
<p>Upon being assigned, the team must do three things for each
project:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pick a team nickname. Puns are welcome and encouraged (e.g., “R-tful
Coders”)</li>
<li>All team members should join and clone the appropriately named git
directory, e.g., Project1_Team1.</li>
<li>Add Professor Kenaley (<span class="citation">@ckenaley</span>) and
other team members as collaborator to this repository (directions <a

<h2>Expectations for Students</h2>
<p>A semi-flipped course, especially one of this technical nature, will
require sublime concentration and focus. Therefore, we must be clear
about our expectations of one another.</p>
<ul>
<li>You, the student, are responsible for reading and adhering to all
aspects of the course syllabus as outlined here on this site.</li>
<li>You are responsible for organizing and completing all readings,
discussions, exercises, and projects.</li>
<li>You are responsible for becoming familiar with course-related
software (R, RStudio, Arduino, etc.).</li>

<h2>Expectations for the Instructor</h2>
<ul>
<li>I will challenge students intellectually to develop data analysis
and experimental skills.</li>
<li>I will make expectations clear in the form of this site, syllabus,
and course announcements made here and over email.</li>
<li>I will be consistent and quick in grading assignments.</li>
<li>I will be available to help and discuss topics during scheduled
class time, arranged office hours, and on our class <a

<div id="discussion-board" class="section level1">
<h1>Discussion Board</h1>
<p>Most weeks, a representative from your team you will be asked to
submit at least one question and answer another on our class <a
href="https://github.com/orgs/bcorgbio/discussions">discussion
board</a>. This is hosted on GitHub, just like our course site and will
certainly be an important resource as you work through course material.
When you post a question, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be polite and concise.</li>
<li>Ask a question that has not be asked before.</li>
<li>Post the question with a short descriptive title (e.g.., ``Problems
with temp sensor wiring” )</li>
</ul>
<p>When responding to a question, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be polite and concise</li>
<li>Provide unique feedback rather than a duplicated answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to post reactions (via the smiley-face icon above the text
box), but this won’t count as an answer.</p>
<p>A team representative is welcome to add another answer to a question
that has already been answered as long as it expands upon the previous
answers. I’ll be moderating and commenting myself, issuing feedback at
the end of each week.</p>
<p>Any team for any project may create their own discussion board. If
your team does so, please add me to the team as well so that I can
monitor questions and provide feedback. Any Q&amp;A on a team discussion
board <strong>DOES NOT</strong> satisfy the general discussion
requirement. You can learn more about making team discussion boards on
GitHub <a

<div id="phase-i-learning-the-basics" class="section level2">
<h2>Phase I: Learning the Basics</h2>
<p>In this phase, we’ll learn the basics of data analysis by working
through 4 learning modules devoted to instrument design and data
analysis. This will most likely be the most challenging part of the
course in that many, if not most of you will not have ever designed and
built instruments and data acquisition systems, let alone analyzed data
from them. There might be a lot of head banging, encountering hurdle
after hurdle. Rest assured, your experience will be curated, sticking to
the bare bones of data science. This introductory phase will set the
groundwork for Phase II, the development of a data analytics
toolbox.</p>
<p>Modules for Phase I include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Data Pirates Code with. . . .</strong> R, Introduction to
the Basics</li>
<li><strong>Data Wrangling:</strong> Introduction to Tools of the Trade
in Data Analysis</li>
<li><strong>The Whiz and Viz Bang of Data:</strong> The Basics of Data
Visualization and Modeling</li>
<li><strong>Making Messes Pretty:</strong> Leveraging Markdown to
Produce Pleasing Reports</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="phase-ii-developing-a-toolbox" class="section level2">
<h2>Phase II: Developing a Toolbox</h2>
<p>In Phase II, we’ll use our new-found code-development skills to
address key questions in organismal biology. These will be largely
guided explorations of data analysis meant to challenge you to put these
skills to good use in answering, for example, how size and phylogeny
matters in physiological systems a changing climate impacts the
distribution of vertebrates. Within this phase we’ll break up into teams
of 3 students to focus on 3 modules devoted to semi-independent analysis
and/or modeling.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Rolly Polly Fish Heads:</strong> Head shape evolution in the
Actinopterygii</li>
<li><strong>Spatial Awareness:</strong> Historical Changes in New
England Mammal Distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Birds of a Feather Migrate Together . . .
Sometimes:</strong> Using EBird data to Explore the Phenology of
Passerine Migration</li>
</ol>
<p>For each module of Phase II, you’ll be asked to read one or two
important topic papers to set the stage and provide crucial context and
then move on to data acquisition, analysis, and synthesis. The end
product of each module will be a short, 3-4 page markdown that includes
some background, description of methods, results, and discussion within
the context of the topic papers and other relevant research.</p>
</div>
<div id="phase-iii-independent-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Phase III: Independent Project</h2>
<p>In Phase III, you’ll be tasked with quickly developing a project of
your own design that requires the fabrication of a new or modified data
acquisition system. The goal of this project is the use your sensor to
answer a question personal and interesting to your team (assembled
during Phase II). The question should be new within the context of the
course and reflect a comparative focus (i.e., not simply a human-based
project). This project will require you to first delve into the the
scientific literature to set the stage and then leverage your new
data-analysis and report-writing skills in the synthesis of 4-5 page
markdown. This final project report should follow the same format and
requirements of the reports produced in Phase II, but with expanded
content.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="course-assessment" class="section level1">
<h1>Course Assessment</h1>
<p>Your grade will be based on five assignment components: Asking and
answering questions on our discussion board, many in-class coding
exercises, and a series of project reports: 4 for Phase I projects, 4
for Phase II projects, and one for the Phase III project.</p>

<p>Note: *the lowest two of the 12 WCRs will be dropped, for a total of
100 pts. <br></p>
<p>The discussion portion of your grade will be calculated by
determining the percentage of times your team both asked and answered a
question when assigned to (usually once per week) and multiplying this
by 50. That is, if you are asked to submit 15 questions and answers over
the course of the semester and post and answer 12, your discussion
points will equal 40. A discussion assignment will be considered
complete if and only if a question is posted AND another answered.</p>
<p>As the name implies, on Wednesday of most weeks, we’ll have Wednesday
Code Reviews (WCRs). These short exercises will assess your aptitude in
scripting, data visualization, and modeling.</p>
<p>More details about the specific requirements of Phase I, II, and III
projects can be found under our “Projects” tab at the top of this
page.</p>

<p>As a reminder, assessment for project reports will incorporate an
evaluation of an individual’s or team’s effort and engagement in
addition to more objective components (i.e., answers, conclusions,
etc.). To do well, the formula is simple: students and their teams
should remain persistent, ask for guidance, and make clear conclusions
using the skills and tools they learn in the course.</p>

<div id="accommodation-and-accessibility" class="section level1">
<h1>Accommodation and Accessibility</h1>
<p>Boston College is committed to providing accommodations to students,
faculty, staff and visitors with disabilities. Specific documentation
from the appropriate office is required for students seeking
accommodation in Woods College courses. Advanced notice and formal
registration with the appropriate office is required to facilitate this
process. There are two separate offices at BC that coordinate services
for students with disabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bc.edu/libraries/help/tutoring.html">The Connors
Family Learning Center (CFLC)</a> coordinates services for students with
LD and ADHD.</li>
<li><a
href="http://www.bc.edu/offices/dos/subsidiary_offices/disabilityservices.html">The
Disabilities Services Office (DSO)</a> coordinates services for all
other disabilities.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div id="scholarship-and-academic-integrity" class="section level1">
<h1>Scholarship and Academic Integrity</h1>
<p>Students in this course, as all others at BC, must produce original
work and cite references appropriately. Failure to cite references is
plagiarism. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not necessarily limited
to, the <em>use of AI</em> (see below) to produce work a student claims
as their own, plagiarism, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty,
cheating on exams or assignments, or submitting the same material or
substantially similar material to meet the requirements of more than one
course without seeking permission of all instructors concerned.
Scholastic misconduct may also involve, but is not necessarily limited
to, acts that violate the rights of other students, such as depriving
another student of course materials or interfering with another
student’s work. Please see the <a
href="https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/academics/sites/university-catalog/policies-procedures.html#academic_integrity_policies">Boston
College policy on academic integrity</a> for more information.</p>
<div id="use-of-ai" class="section level2">
<h2>Use of AI</h2>
<p>Generative AI can be an incredibly powerful tool for anyone
interested in writing a little code—you can ask it to do so much for
you, and most of the time, what it produces works relatively well. Thus,
it may be tempting for anyone new to modeling and data science to rely
on this tool, in part or whole, for many of the assignments for this
course. In your instructor’s opinion, relying on AI would make the
learning goals and objectives of the course hard to reach. His opinion
is that it can be helpful, but can often stifle learning and be used
irresponsibly. So that we’re all on the same page with regard to how AI
fits into the course, students should read, understand, and follow this
AI policy.</p>
<div id="requirements" class="section level3">
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>All students must attribute AI as the source of any work (i.e., you
must cite your AI sources and specifically how they were used).
Therefore, there must be a statement in every piece of submitted work
that outlines how AI was used in the execution of the project.</li>
<li>Students may <em>NOT</em> submit AI-generated work as wholesale
substitutes for the work expected of them. In other words, any work a
student submits must be, by and large, produced by that student and not
the direct output of AI.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="guidelines-for-acceptable-use" class="section level3">
<h3>Guidelines for Acceptable Use</h3>
<p>AI may be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brainstorming and code-review preparation.</li>
<li>Debugging code and error interpretations.</li>
<li>Finding guidance concerning how to implement code in an analysis
(e.g, appropriate functions, syntax, and logic).</li>
<li>Background research on a topic or quantitative method.</li>
<li>Generating a lists of potentially relevant sources to read.</li>
<li>Editing text for clarity, spelling and grammar.</li>
<li>Many other things.*</li>
</ul>
<p>*If you come to a point where you’re using AI and unsure if this
particular use falls in the “acceptable” category, please talk with
Prof. K. He’ll provide some guidance.</p>
</div>
<div id="penalties" class="section level3">
<h3>Penalties</h3>
<p>Any work submitted that violates this policy will be considered a
breach of <a
href="https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/academics/sites/university-catalog/policies-procedures.html#academic_integrity_policies">the
University’s broader policy on academic integrity</a>. Violations of the
policy may incur penalties that include a grade of 0 for a violating
assignment, a formal academic integrity inquiry, and/or failing grade
for course.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="email-and-office-hours-policy" class="section level1">
<h1>Email and Office Hours Policy</h1>
<p>If you write Professor Kenaley with a question, he’ll try to get back
to you within 24 hours. Rather than write Prof. Kenaley with questions
related to course mechanics and expectations, please post these in our
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/bcorgbio/discussions">discussion
board</a>, It’s probably the case that others have the same
questions.</p>
<p>Office hours can be arranged by appointment via email and will take
in person (Higgins 535). Office hours may involve more more than student
or team, so please come equipped with poignant questions and expect that
other students have questions as urgent as yours.</p>
