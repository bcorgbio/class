title: "DaqPack Materials"

---

Thanks to a generous grant from [BC's Academic Technology Avisory Board](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/academics/sites/academic-technology-advisory-board.html.html), we are able to provide "DaqPacks" of all the required hardware for the course to every student in BIOL 3140. Please take care of your DaqPacks, keeping them in a safe, dry place. There are lots of bits and pieces and what's below describes each.
