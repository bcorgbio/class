# Phase I: The basics

In this phase, we'll learn the basics of instrumentation and data analysis by working through 5 learning modules devoted to instrument design and data analysis. This will most likely be the most challenging part of the course in that many, if not most of you will not have ever designed and built instruments and data acquisition systems, let alone analyzed data from them. Rest assured, your experience will be curated, sticking to the bare bones of instrument design and data science. This introductory phase will set the groundwork for Phase II, the independent development of sensors and data analysis.

# Module 1: Data Pirates Code with. . . . R, Introduction to the Basics

In this module we'll tackle where to find resource you'll need on a week-to-week, module-by-module basis. In addition, we'll work on the first important topic of the course: an introduction to R, an ever more popular language for data analysis and visualization. We'll focus on the basics of importing and tidying data in R. By importing, we mean loading data collected by scientists and stored in text files, the lingua franca of scientific data. By tidying, we mean preparing data for analysis.

## Dates 
Weeks 1 & 2 (Aug 31—Sep 13):

## Key Concepts
  + Course workflow
  + Course expectations
  + R user interface
  + Working directory
  + Objects, functions, arguments, and scripts in R
  + Lists, data frames, and matrices
  + Basic R notation
  + The `for` loop
  
## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this week and module, students will be able to:

  + Know what is expected during Phase I of the course
  + Open R and RStudio
  + Set a working directory and load data in R
  + Recognize the difference between different objects (e.g., vectors, lists, data frames etc.)
  + Perform simple data operations and manipulation of data objects in R
  + Construct and run a `for` loop in R to automate a interatively redundant task.

# Module 2: Data Wrangling: Introduction to Tools of the Trade in Data Analysis

This module is intended to give students the background and skills to begin simple data tidying and transformation operations. We need our data to be tidy before we can analyze it that, that is, structured in a way that makes analysis possible. In addition, often the data we have aren't exactly what we want to analyze. For example, say you had data on the f
