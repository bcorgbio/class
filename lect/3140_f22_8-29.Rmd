# Teams and team responsibilities

- Take this survey: https://forms.gle/VdtMQWQ2G9FGViT4A

- Teams of 4 students assigned in the first few days of class. 

This team must establish two things:

  1. A *unique* team name. *Puns are welcome* and encouraged (e.g., "R-tful Coders") 
  
  2. A team discussion on GitHub that includes me (@ckenaley) on the team (see [Discussion Board](https://bcorgbio.github.io/class/index.html#Discussion_Board)). 
  
 Each week, teams use their team discussion board to generate a question

 This gets posted on the the class-wide discussion board. Include the team handle ("@bcorgbio/r-tful-coders").
