# Phase I: The Basics

In this phase, we'll learn the basics of data analysis by working through 5 learning modules devoted to core topics in the field. This will most likely be the most challenging part of the course because many, if not most of you will not have ever designed and built instruments and data acquisition systems, let alone analyzed data from them. Rest assured, your experience will be curated, sticking to the bare bones of instrument design and data science. This introductory phase will set the groundwork for Phase II, the independent development of sensors and data analysis.

## Module 1: Data Pirates Code with. . . . R, Introduction to the Basics

<a name="mod1"></a>
In this module we'll tackle where to find resource you'll need on a week-to-week, module-by-module basis. In addition, we'll work on the first important topic of the course: an introduction to R, an ever more popular language for data analysis and visualization. We'll focus on the basics of importing and tidying data in R. By importing, we mean loading data collected by scientists and stored in text files, the common currency of scientific analysis. By tidying, we mean preparing data for analysis.

## Module 2: Data Wrangling: Introduction to Tools of the Trade in Data Analysis


This module is intended to give students the background and skills to begin simple data tidying and transformation operations. We need our data to be tidy before we can analyze it, that is, structured in a way that makes analysis possible. In addition, often the data we have aren't exactly what we want to analyze. In this module, we'll focus on how to read, tidy, and merge data.

### Key Concepts
  + Reading text files in R
  + Adding data based on data (i.e., data transformation)
  + Summarize data according to variables
  + Tidying data in R
  + Relational data and merging data sets

### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this week and module, students will be able to:

  + Read text data into R.
  + Pivot data from wide to longer formats and vice versa.
  + Add columns of data to a data set based on values in other columns.

# Phase II: Developing a Toolbox

In Phase II, we'll use our new-found instrument- and code-development skills to address key questions in organismal biology. These will be self-guided explorations of instrument design and use and data analysis meant to challenge you to put these skills to good use in answering how vertebrates muscles work, phylogeny matters in physiological systems, and how a changing climate impacts the distribution of vertebrates. Within this phase we'll break up into our teams to focus on 4 modules, some data driven, the others both data and instrument driven.

## Module 5: Shark!

This module puts our newly formed data analysis and markdown skills to use in answering how body shape evolved in the Selachii (i.e., sharks). Specifically, we'll test whether body shape has evolved differently between sharks inhabiting different habitats.

## Module 7:   Birds of a Feather Migrate Together . . . Sometimes: Using EBird data to Explore the Phenology of Passerine Migration (data driven)

In this module, we'll explore the phenology of spring arrival timing for neotropical passerines as it relates to historical weather conditions. To do so, we'll download species occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), an international network and data infrastructure whose goal is to provide users open access to data about all types of life on Earth. We'll access GBIF data using [`rgif`](https://www.gbif.org/tool/81747/rgbif), an R package that permits access to GBIF's application programming interface (API). An API permits a user to interact with multiple software pieces (databases, code sources for processing and analysis, etc.). To assemble historical weather data, we'll also use another R package, `rnoa`. This package contains functions that interact with [NOAA's National Climatic Data Center's API](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2).

### Important Dates 

Sunday, 11/24: Commit Module 7 Project report

### Key Concepts

  + API
  + Phenology
  + Migrations
  + Linear Mixed-effects Modeling

### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this week and module, students will be able to:

  + Download data using R's interface to one of several APIs.
  + Apply linear mixed-effect models to biological data.
  + Comment on how climatic and meteorological conditions may effect bird poulaiton.

# Phase III: Final Projects

### Imporant Dates 

Wednesday,12/16: Commit Final Project report

In Phase III, you'll be tasked with quickly developing a project of your own design that  either (1) requires the fabrication of a new or modified data acquisition system or (2) the acquisition of data from a peer-reviewed study or database. The goal of this project is to answer a question personal and interesting to your team. The question should be new within the context of the course and reflect a physiological focus (i.e., not ). This project will require you to first delve into the the scientific literature to set the stage and then leverage your new data-analysis and report-writing skills in the synthesis of 4-5 page markdown. This final project report should follow the same format and requirements of the reports produced in Phase II, but with expanded content. 

More details about the final project and its expectations can be found [here](final_proj.html).
