This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, inlcude=FALSE}

teams <- c("cod(h)ers",
"Coders-R-COOL",
"Coding R-senal",
"Experimental Eagles",
"I.M.A.K.",
"R-ctic Monkeys",
"StringCheese",
"Team 2"
)

# General Guidelines

tasks <- c("Completes all tasks fully; submits all required outputs and materials on time (10 pts)",
           "Completes a majority but not all tasks fully; submission meets the deadline (6 points)",
           "Completes few required taks or submits few required matrials; submission misses the deadline (2 pts)")

effort <- c("Individual or team asks questions or seeks help regularly (10 pts)",
            "Individual or team asks questions or seek help sometimes, but not regularly (6 pts)",
            "Individual or team does not seem help (2 pts)")

format <- c( "Report contains all the appropriate headings and components (including a bibliography) (5 pts)",  "Report contains most of the appropriate headings and components (including a bibliography) (3 pts)",   "Report contains few of the appropriate headings and components (1 pt)")


analysis <-  c("Report contains concisely written code chunks within the results or methods sections that produce the appropriate analyses, figures, and/or tables (10 pts)",
"One or a few code chunks are unneeded or produce analyses, figures, and/or tables not directly related to the project goals (6 pts)", "No code chunks contained in report or all code chunks are unneeded or produce analyses, figures, and/or tables not directly related to the project goals (2 pts)")

graphics <-  c("Figures, tables, and images are clear, add much to the results in anlysis, and have concise but descriptive captions (5 pts)",   "One or a few figures, tables, and images are unneeded or inaapropriate or they lack captions that are concise or descriptive  (3 pts)",  "All few figures, tables, and images are unneeded or inaapropriated (1 pt)")

writing <- c("The writing is concise, clear, avoids passive constructions, and is in the past tense; grammar is appropriate (5 pts)",   "The writing is unclear or rambling in spots or uses passive constructions and future tense; grammar is shaky in spots (3 pts)",   "The writing is unclear, and/or uses passive constructions or future tense throughout; grammar is shaky for the most part (1 pt)")

sources <- c("Statements of scientific findings and fact are supported by references; references are contained in a BibTex bibliography and inserted with `@` tags  (5 pts)", "Some statements of scientific findings and fact are not supported by references; some references are not contained in a BibTex bibliography or inserted with `@` tags (3 pts)",   "Most statements of scientific findings and fact are not supported by references; references are not contained in a BibTex bibliography nor inserted with `@` tags (1 pt)")

# Tasks and Outputs 


```{r textbox, echo=FALSE}

names(tasks) <- c("Competent (10)", "Not Yet Competent (6)", "Needs Work(2)")


selectInput("Category Score", "", choices = c('1'='1','2'='2'))

bsselect(tasks, type = "text")

inputPanel(
    textInput('task_comm', h3('Text Input'), value='')
          )
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
