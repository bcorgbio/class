# Phase I: The basics

In this phase, we'll learn the basics of instrumentation and data analysis by working through XX learning modules devoted to instrument design and data analysis. This will most likely be the most challenging part of the course in that many, if not most of you will not have ever designed and built instruments and data acquisition systems, let alone analyzed data from them. Rest assured, your experience will be curated, sticking to the bare bones of instrument design and data science. This introductory phase will set the groundwork for Phase II, the independent development of sensors and data analysis.

## Module 1: Introduction and Cheap Tricks

This module is intended to give students the background and skills to begin designing and programing of simple hardware devices using Arduino.

#### Project Report

No need to write anything up. Please merely run the modified sketch on your temp sensor protype and upload a video of the serial monitor printing comma separated values. You can capture the video by recording the screen on your phone and upload it [here](https://forms.gle/gRHLVdGKh4bsF3Md7). Please upload the video by 11:59 PM on Sunday, September 6th.  

## Module 2: Data Pirates Code with. . . . R, Introduction to the Basics

In this module we'll learn the basics of coding in R. This introduction to R assumes no previous experience with R specifically or programming in general. The focus of this module will be on learning how R works and appreciating some of its potential in performing simple data operations like loading it, evaluating its different types, subsetting data objects, and iterating quickly through repetative tasks. 

### Dates: 
Week 2 (Sep 7—13):

### Key Concepts:
  + R user interface
  + Working directory
  + Objects, functions, arguments, and scripts in R
  + Lists, data frames, and matrices
  + Basic R notation
  + The `for` loop
  
### Learning Objectives:

Upon completion of this week and module, students will be able to:

  + Open R and RStudio
  + Set a working directory and load data in R
  + Recognize the difference between different objects (e.g., vectors, lists, data frames etc.)
  + Perform simple data operations and manipulation of data objects in R
  + Contruct and run a `for` loop in R to automate a interatively redundant task.
 
### Read/Watch: 

All from [Hands on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr) (HOPR)

  + [Appendices A—D](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) 
  + [Part I](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/project-1-weighted-dice.html)

  + [Chapter 11.3: For Loops](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/loops.html#for-loops)
 
When reading through HOPR, make sure to have R and R Studio up and running so that you can copy and paste code from HOPR into an R file and run the specified commands and complete the books project tasks. This will help tremendously in getting the hang of things.
