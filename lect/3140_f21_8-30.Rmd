# Teams and team responsibilities

- Take this survey: https://forms.gle/Z7PekUE3wB6FQQoa8

- Teams of 4 students assigned in the first few days of class. 


This team must establish two things:

  1. A *unique* team name. *Puns are welcome* and encouraged (e.g., "R-tful Coders") 
  
  2. A team discussion on GitHub that includes me (@ckenaley) on the team (see [Discussion Board]). 
  
 Each week, teams use their team discussion board to generate a question

 This gets posted on the the class-wide discussion board. include the team handle ("@bcorgbio/r-tful-coders").
