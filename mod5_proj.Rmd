# Introduction

Now that we have learned the basics of data analysis, visualization, and modeling. Let's move on to how we collect data in the first place. So much of experimental work in organismal biology requires specialized equipment. Often, equipment is expensive or devices and instruments needed for the work aren't commercially available. Because of the expense and unique requirements of instruments, organismal biologist often make their own. Prototyping instruments can be tedious and challenging, often requiring collaboration with engineers or other technical consultants. However, many simple sensor-based instruments that fit the requirements of researchers can be built around Arduino, an open source, inexpensive prototyping platform. 

In this project, we'll proceed with prototyping a simple sensor, one that can very accurately record temperature. This project assumes you have worked through the the assigned readings and links and therefore understand how an Arduino Uno (or a clone) is programmed and how serial data are sent and received from an Arduino.

# Set up

## Materials

Assemble the following materials from your DaqPacks

  + DS18B20 precision linear digiral temperature sensor
  + Elegoo Arduino Uno clone
  + variety of jumper or prototyping wires
  + wiring breadboard
  
# Assembly and Programming

## Assembly
Be sure to read this post about [DS18B20 Sensor](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/guide-for-ds18b20-temperature-sensor-with-arduino/)---it provides a good overview of this temp sensor and explicit instructions for assembling and programming an Arduino-based temperature recording system.

Let's start with assembly. First, we'll wire the three pins of the DS18B20 according the this diagram:

</center>
<br>

**NOTE** Be very careful wiring this sensor. Be sure of the following using a breadboard, otherwise you may fry the sensor:

  + The red ("+" or "VCC") pin on the sensor module is wired to the 5V pin on the Arduino and 
  + The blacke ("GND" or "-") pin on the sensor is wired to the GND pin on the Arduino
  + The yellow ("S" or data) pin on the sensor is wired to a digital pin on the Arduino (D2 will do).
  + Use the provided 4.7K pullup resistor between the data and the 5V pint 

## Programming

You'll first have to add a few libraries---Onew Wire and Dallas Temperature---to your Arduino IDE following the directions in the [guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/guide-for-ds18b20-temperature-sensor-with-arduino/) linked above. Follow the section in  While adding the library, you may see a prompt asking if you'd like to also install missing dependencies (things the these library also needs to run). Go ahead and click "install all". 

Once the library is installed, click on **File &#8594; Examples &#8594; Dallas Temperatue &#8594; Simple** to open an example sketch. You may have to close and restart the IDE for the example sketch to appear. 

If everything is in order---you've chosen the right port and board in Arduino IDE---you can now click upload or `Ctrl`/Cmd`+`u` and then the serial monitor icon the IDE (or pres "cmd/ctrl+shift+m") to see what data are being printed from the microcontroller to your computer over the serial (USB) port. It should look something like this. If so, CONGRATS! You're recording temperature data!

</center>
<br>

Notice the serial monitor is ouputting data from the Arduino that include temperature (in °C and ). This is great, but as a scientist, you're probably building this instrument to record temperature over some length of time. Thus, reporting when, relative to the start of the experiment, the temperature was recorded is important. Fortunately, modifying the output is a piece of cake.

First, recording and printing time to the serial connection is super easy. We can do this by adding a new variable `currentTime` and passing a time value in milliseconds to this variable in the void loop. First, add `int currentTime;` to the top of the sketch where the other variables are established. `int` establishes the variable as an integer, which is just fine because milliseconds is recorded as whole numbers. Second, add this to the `void(loop)`:

```{}  
  //add line to record current time 
  currentTime=millis(); 
 
  //add line to print current time 
  Serial.print("Time = ");
  Serial.println(currentTime);
```

This first line above records the time in milliseconds. The second and third lines print a prefix and the value for the current time. Notice there's `Serial.print()` and `Serial.println()`. The later is identical to the former, however, `Serial.println` prints the value and then a new line. 

An amended code looks something like this:

```{}

//add current time variable
int currentTime;

// Include the libraries we need
#include <OneWire.h>
#include <DallasTemperature.h>

// Data wire is plugged into port 2 on the Arduino
#define ONE_WIRE_BUS 2

// Setup a oneWire instance to communicate with any OneWire devices (not just Maxim/Dallas temperature ICs)
OneWire oneWire(ONE_WIRE_BUS);

// Pass our oneWire reference to Dallas Temperature. 
DallasTemperature sensors(&oneWire);

/*
 * The setup function. We only start the sensors here
 */
void setup(void)
{
  // start serial port
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Dallas Temperature IC Control Library Demo");

  // Start up the library
  sensors.begin();
}

/*
 * Main function, get and show the temperature
 */
void loop(void)
{ 
  // call sensors.requestTemperatures() to issue a global temperature 
  // request to all devices on the bus
  Serial.print("Requesting temperatures...");
  sensors.requestTemperatures(); // Send the command to get temperatures
  Serial.println("DONE");
  // After we got the temperatures, we can print them here.
  // We use the function ByIndex, and as an example get the temperature from the first sensor only.
  float tempC = sensors.getTempCByIndex(0);

  // Check if reading was successful
  if(tempC != DEVICE_DISCONNECTED_C) 
  {
    Serial.print("Temperature for the device 1 (index 0) is: ");
    Serial.println(tempC);
     //add line to record current time 
  currentTime=millis(); 
 
  //add line to print current time 
  Serial.print("Time = ");
  Serial.println(currentTime);
  } 
  else
  {
    Serial.println("Error: Could not read temperature data");
  }
}


```

Check in on the serial monitor. Notice that there's now a new line (outlined below in red) that reports time in milliseconds:

![FigName](serialtime.png)
</center>
<br>

Notice that the data are being printed about ever second (2000 ms) or so. This is because the first line of the `void(loop)` is `delay(2000)`. The `delay()` function delays or stops the loop for a specified number of milliseconds.

OK, this much better, but, as we learned in Module 2, data need to be parsed (i.e., arranged) in particular ways for a scientists to read data into a computer and then work with it. One of the standard parsing conventions or formats is comma separated values (.csv). If we can get our data to be printed to the serial monitor separated by commas, then we just have to copy the data from the the serial monitor and paste it into a text file. Later in the course, we'll learn how to save the data to an SD card, but for now, let's set up serial printing so that we can copy it. 

To do this, we need to rearrange and add some `Serial.print()` commands to the `void(loop)` section that controls printing. So rather than . . . 

```{}
  //add line to record current time 
 unsigned long currentTime; 
  
  //add line to print current time 
  Serial.print("Time = ");
  Serial.println(currentTime);
  Serial.print(F("Humidity: "));
  Serial.print(50);
  Serial.print(F("%  Temperature: "));
  Serial.print(22);
  Serial.print(F("°C "));
  Serial.print(74);
  Serial.print(F("°F  Heat index: "));
  Serial.print(22);
  Serial.print(F("°C "));
  Serial.print(74);
  Serial.println(F("°F"));
  
```

 . . . let's ditch the error handling `if` loop,  prefixes (e.g., `Serial.print("Requesting temperatures...");`) and unneeded message and print data semparated by some commas. Replace the entire void loop with this:
 
 Notice the last serial print command is  `Serial.println()` to start a new line before the next data are printed. 
```{}
 void loop(void)
{ 
  // call sensors.requestTemperatures() to issue a global temperature 
  // request to all devices on the bus
  
  sensors.requestTemperatures(); // Send the command to get temperatures
  
    //add line to record current time 
  currentTime=millis(); 
  // After we got the temperatures, we can print them here.
  // We use the function ByIndex, and as an example get the temperature from the first sensor only.
  float tempC = sensors.getTempCByIndex(0);

     Serial.print(currentTime);
     Serial.print(",");
     Serial.println(tempC);
    
}
```

Now we're only printing time (in ms) and temperature (in °C). If your wondering where the `tempC` variable comes from, it's this line in the loop that reads temperature from the module and stores it.
 
 ```{}
 float tempC = sensors.getTempCByIndex(0);
```

Notice that, there's still and unneeded message printed at the beginning of the program. Delete this from the `setup` void.

```
 Serial.println("Dallas Temperature IC Control Library Demo");
```
  
Upload the sketch and have a look at the serial monitor. Notice that we have data for milliseconds and temp in &deg;C separated by commas. That is, we have comma separated values (.csv)! There's just one problem with this---unless you knew the inner workings of this sketch, you wouldn't know which data were which. Is the first value time or temperature? Printing a header at the beginning of the program is the solution. After this, the header and data can be copied and pasted to a text file and any computing operations that follow will logically parse and have a name for each column or position in the series of data. 

Here's how to proceed. Merely print some header/column names in the `setup(void)`. The `setup(void)` is a part of the sketch where you ask the microcontroller to do something once and *before* `void(loop)` commences, a perfect place to print the header to the serial port.

```{}
//add header
Serial.println("ms,degC");
```

After adding this and uploading the modified sketch, the serial monitor should now print a header (i.e., column names) and then the data like this:

![FigName](serialtime2.png)
</center>
<br>

This new modified Arduino sketch follows here:

```{}
//add header
Serial.println("ms,degC");
```


# Saving Data from the Serial Monitor

It would be very easy to integrate another piece of hardware, namely and SD card board, to save data. However, for this module and the other that requires Arduino data, saving your data for now can be as simple as copying the data printed to the serial monitor and pasting it into a text file. The code we're working with produces comma-separated values for easy reading into analysis software, like R. 

Be sure to copy your data into a text file, not a Word document or Excel. I suggest using a free text editing like [BBedit (for Mac)](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html) or [Notepadd++ (for Windows)](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/). 

## Working with metadata

```{r,include=F}

library(tidyverse)

nm <- c("Hansel","Derek","Mugato","Matilda")

for(i in nm){
  for(w in c("couch","active")){
  hot.i <- data.frame(ms=seq(1,100000,1000),degC=degC <-runif(100,37,39))
  hot.i <- hot.i%>%
    mutate(degC=round(degC,2))
  
  cold.i <- data.frame(ms=seq(1,100000,1000),degC=degC.c <-runif(100,36,38))
  cold.i <- cold.i%>%
    mutate(degC=round(degC,2))
  write_csv(cold.i,path=paste0(i,"_",w,".csv"))
}
}



list.files(pattern = "couch|active.csv")
  
```

When saving data in a research project, be sure to give the data a standard and informative file name. This is **essential for saving data**. For instance, say we were studying the effect of exercise on body temperature in four human subjects: [Derek, Hansel, Matilda, and Mugato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ-8IuUkJJc). Imagine that we measured body temperature over 100 seconds, twice for each subject, once when they were inactive (on the couch) and once after 5 minutes of jumping jacks (active). A logical file-naming convention would be "Name_couch/active.csv". 
So, say we have these 4 subjects and two experimental conditions, we'd have the following 8 files:

 + "Derek_active.csv"
 + "Derek_couch.csv"
 + "Hansel_active.csv"
 + "Hansel_couch.csv"  
 + "Matilda_active.csv" 
 + "Matilda_couch.csv"
 + "Mugato_active.csv"
 + "Mugato_couch.csv"  

Giving files a name describing the experiment (who and condition in this case) is an easy way of storing **metadata** (data about the data). For any subsequent analysis, we can pull the metadata from the file name and store our data with these conditions stored as columns. If we consider loading data with R, the power of a `for` loop because apparent. Using a `for` loop, we can iteratively load each data file, strip the metadata, and store both in a table. In this example, such a loop might look like this:

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
dat.f <- list.files(pattern = "couch|active.csv") #find the files

dat.l <- list() #make an empty list

for(i in dat.f){
  met.dat<- unlist(strsplit(i,"_")) #split of the filename string
  who <- met.dat[1] #store the first element
  activity <- gsub(".csv","",met.dat[2]) #store second element, dropping CSV with gsub()
  dat.l[[i]]<- read_csv(i)%>%
    mutate(who=who,activity=activity) #read, then store data with additional columns of metada in list as position unique to i
  
}
dat <- do.call(rbind,dat.l) #combine the list into table

dat%>%
  ggplot()+geom_boxplot(aes(x=activity,y=degC))+facet_grid(.~who) #plot to see what we get

```

A workflow like this, formulated around standardized file names containing metadata, is eminently scalable. Eight or a 1000 files, this approach works well.


# Project Report

In this project report, we'll mirror the process of future projects and reports in Phase II and III of the course. Specifically, we'll define a question, get data with a prototyped Arduino-based sensor and data-acquisition system, analyze and visualize it in R, and answer the question in an R Markdown report. For this report, we'll simply ask *Does body temperature vary in human subjects according to activity level?*.

To answer this question, use your new Arduino temp sensor to record the body temperature of each group member for a 100 s while sitting on the couch (or during some other calm activity---but make sure each group member does the same thing!) and after 5 minutes of doing jumping jacks.  Record axillary temperature by putting the sensor in your armpit. 

Make sure, in your project, you:

  + Record data from the active and inactive conditions for all group members.
  + Save data from the serial monitor via copy and paste operations, giving each text file a descriptive, standardized file name containing metadata.
  + Combine all data from your team into one table.
  + Plot mean temperature +/- 1 standard deviation, focusing on the comparison of activities between subjects. 
  
  
This report will require you to submit an .Rmd with HTML output that includes all the sections required of future project reports. Keep each section short, including only 3-4 sentences. Here are some key components to include:


  + Find and cite a study in the introduction that frames the question, i.e., what is known about the effect of activity on body temperature.
  + Qualitatively assess the effect of activity on body temperature with a single concise figure in the results section. Be sure to include a short narrative of the findings.
  + Find, cite, and comment on a study in the discussion that frames the results, i.e., are your result congruent or not with previous findings and why? 
  + In the author contributions section, include short, explicit statements of each team member's role in executing the project. 
  
Push your .Rmd to your team's repo on GitHub. **Submissions are due by 11:59 pm on Tuesday, October 10th.**

Good luck!!
