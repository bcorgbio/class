# Teams and team responsibilities

- Teams of 3 students assigned in the first few days of class. 

This team must establish two things:

  1. Pick a team nickname. Puns are welcome and encouraged (e.g., "R-tful Coders") 
  2. Have a single team member create a github repository titled ProjectNumber_TeamNumber, e.g., "Project2_Team2" (directions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)). Note: only one person in the team should create a project repo.
  4. Add Professor Kenaley (@ckenaley) and other team members as collaborator to this repository (directions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository))
  5. A team representative must submit a question to our [discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/bcorgbio/discussions) and include the team handle in the question title.
  6. A team representative must answer a question on the discussion board and include the team handle in the response.
