# First, some history


.pull-left[
The comparative methods:

- Documenting diversity of traits 

- Quantifying their intercorrelations 

- Speculating on their evolution

Before Felsenstein (1985), no theoretical method to account for phylogeny and this effect was largely ignored of explained away.

## What is a model?

> This paper addresses a complex and important issue, and provides a solution to part of the problem—a very unsatisfactory solution, as the author is well aware, given the degree to which our data will usually fall short of the quality required by the method he proposes. … Nevertheless, as far as I can tell the method does what is claimed, and it is probably worth publishing.
